# SMART PILL BOTTLE


## Abstract:
This proposal introduces a Smart Pill Bottle system, an innovative application of IoT in healthcare,
designed to enhance medication adherence. By integrating IoT technology into traditional pill bottles,
this system provides patients with reminders and tracking capabilities, ensuring timely medication intake.
The project aims to improve patient outcomes and streamline healthcare processes by leveraging smart technology.

## Objective:
### The Smart Pill Bottle project aims to:

1. Develop IoT-enabled pill bottles equipped with sensors and alert mechanisms to remind patients when it's time to take their medication.
2. Implement adherence tracking features to monitor medication usage and alert healthcare providers of missed doses.
3. Create a user-friendly mobile application for patients to set medication schedules, receive reminders, and track adherence.
4. Ensure data security and compliance with healthcare regulations to protect patient privacy.
5. Facilitate seamless integration with pharmacy systems and electronic health records for comprehensive medication management.

## Outcome:
### The Smart Pill Bottle system is expected to:

1. Improve medication adherence by providing timely reminders and tracking capabilities.
2. Empower patients to take control of their medication regimen and adhere to prescribed treatments.
3. Enhance patient-provider communication through real-time adherence monitoring and intervention alerts.
4. Reduce medication-related complications and hospitalizations by promoting consistent adherence.
5. Optimize healthcare resource utilization by streamlining medication management processes and reducing medication errors.
